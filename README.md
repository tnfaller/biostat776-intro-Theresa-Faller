# A Brief Introduction
This website contains a brief introduction to Theresa Faller

### Introduction

Hi!  My name is Theresa Faller, and I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Mental Health Department.  My research interests include the intersection of physical and mental health, with a growing focus on the opioid epidemic and its influence on suicide risk.  Before coming to Hopkins, I was a research fellow working with the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine studying the epidemiology of injury and psychological outcomes in active duty soldiers.  

I'm originally from the Boston area, but I'm currently located in Baltimore.  In my free time, I like to hike, try new restaurants with my husband, go to trivia with friends, and tend to my growing collection of house plants.



### Some Fun Facts About Me:

1. I went to undergrad at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME and love all things Maine.

2. I took Japanese in high school and college and studied abroad there one summer.  Unfortunately I've forgotten a lot...

3. I'm one of four siblings with one older sister and two younger brothers.  Up until my youngest brother got into Columbia for grad school, we all went to undergrad and grad schools starting with the letter 'B'.

4. I got married this summer in Salem, MA!

5. In college, my family was featured on the Steve Harvey talk show, back when they filmed in Chicago.  People always ask if it was Family Feud, and while unfortunately no, it was still a great time!
